# RBAC System (Role-Based Access Control)
 This project is a simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with React. It allows users to manage users and roles, including CRUD operations for both. The system demonstrates the use of React Context API, mock APIs, and modern component-based architecture.
